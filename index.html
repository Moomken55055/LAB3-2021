			<p><strong>Neom (styled NEOM; Arabic: نيوم‎ Neom, Hejazi pronunciation: [nɪˈjo̞ːm]) is a planned cross-border
		city in the Tabuk Province of northwestern Saudi Arabia.
		It is planned to incorporate smart city technologies and also function as a tourist destination.
		The site is north of the Red Sea, east of Egypt across the
		Strait of Tiran, and south of Israel and Jordan.[2] It will cover a total area of
		26,500 km2 (10,200 sq mi) and will extend 460 km along the coast of the Red Sea.
		Saudi Arabia aims to complete the first section of NEOM by 2025.[3][4] The project
		has an estimated cost of $500 billion.[5] On January 29, 2019, Saudi Arabia has announced
		setting up a closed joint-stock company named NEOM with $500 billion.[6] The aim of this company 
		that is wholly owned by the Public Investment Fund, the sovereign wealth fund,
		is to develop the economic zone of Neom.[7] The project is planned to be totally powered by renewable energy sources.
		[8] Nadhmi Al-Nasr is the CEO of the NEOM Joint-stock company.[9] </strong></p>

		مستقبل‎, romanized: Mustaqbal, Hejazi pronunciation: [mʊsˈtagbal], the Arabic word for “future.”[18]</i></p>
